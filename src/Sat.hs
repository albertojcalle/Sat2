TODO: Check topological order of scc output

Supposedly scc uses Tarjan's algorithm, so the output is in reverse topological order. topSort should be avoided in this case as it is simpler just to reverse the order.

{-|
Collapses all the components in a particular solution.

If there are already positive Assignments for a literal, opposite literals must be assigned to false so the whole component sign is flipped. In the solution a negative sign implies the literal value is false.

Either returns the first contradiction that makes the problem unsolvable or a list of equivalences in the formula. An equivalence is a sorted list of literals which could have the same value.
